These are the code samples for this application. 

It was using an off-shoot of using Entities to create objects that would be used in the app. The persistent data was not solely created using a database, but via files and C#'s/.Net's file reader/writer features.  I chose this on purpose to; a) gain experience in file reading/writing, and b) because trying to create a modular database, that could be used by other people, is a bit of a pain. 

In future applications, I will focus more solely on web applications (due to the modularity involved in them). 

Please feel free to look through the code, and give me any feedback (especially likes! :D ). If you would like to collab, or possible job opportunities, hit me up on my LinkedIn account (that is in my Readme file). 

If you want to use this as a base, please let me know and include this:
